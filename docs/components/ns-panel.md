## Introduction

> The `ns-panel` component is an empty container for each section on a page.

Each `ns-panel` provides an area to place a layout, add an optional decoration and apply the appropriate margins.

## Content guidance

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Decoration | This...    |
| B | Top offset | This...    |
| C | Bottom offset | This... |
| D | Columns | This... |

## Decoration

Adding decoration to an `ns-panel` utilises a coloured background. It provides visual separation from other sections on the page and introduces brand [colour](foundations/colours.md) and style.

The decoration has configurable top and bottom margins. These are adjusted separately from the content and allow the content to overlap these edges, if required, to achieve a more visually desirable layout.

By default there is no decoration applied.

## Columns and content

It is possible to apply a number of columns to a layout within a single `ns-panel` by adding the `ns-column` component within it. (Note the 3 cards in the images above have been added this way. See [ns-column](ns-column.md)).

Another way to configure the layout is to use the `ns-content` component withing `ns-panel`. This allows formatting text and vertical spacing (see [ns-content](ns-content.md))

## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Use decoration to visually separate content | Add decoration to an `ns-panel` where the previous `ns-panel` has a decoration |
| Use appropriate colour for the purpose of page in decorations | Nest a panel in a panel |
| Include more than one layout option in a `ns-panel` |  |

### Considerations of best practice

* Treat each `ns-panel` as a section of the page.
* Include no more than two `ns-lockups` in one `ns-panel` with a decoration.
* Layout options are either a `div`, `ns-article`, `ns-content`, `ns-column` or `ns-lockup`.

## Usage

<StorybookStory story="components-ns-panel--content"></StorybookStory>

## Component placement

The ns-panel component can be used in the following elements/components:

* first child of `<main>`
* [ns-tabs](components/ns-tabs.md)
