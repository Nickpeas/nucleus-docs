## Introduction

> The ns-standout component's purpose is to draw attention to important information that the user will need to know. 

Use the ns-standout component to make information stand out from a page and to visually differentiate a concise block of text from the content that surrounds it, for example:

* Quotes
* Call-outs
* Examples
* Additional information about the page
* Emergency information

## Accessibility 

The component is not announced to screen readers to help differentiate it from [ns-highlighter](../components/ns-highlighter) messages. You can choose from different coloured borders, but the text and background retain the standard colours, therefore, meeting suitable contrast ratios. 

## Content guidance

| Key | Field type | Guidelines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Border | These are of a uniform thickness. You can choose between green-light, blue, cyan, yellow or red 'decoration' which use the [gradient colour palette](https://www.britishgas.co.uk/nucleus/demo/index.html?path=/story/foundations-gradients--gradient-pallette). |
| B | Content | You can style this area with text styles using HTML, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and text links as required. |


## Best practice

| ðŸ’š Do's | ðŸ’” Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- |
| Keep concise and to the point |  Fill with many paragraphs |
| Limit use to 1 or 2 per page |  Overuse it everywhere - it dilutes the impact |
| Use it to make information stand out |  Use it in place of ns-highlighter â€“ that has a different purpose |
| Select a colour border decoration that works with your design | Add images or illustrations | 
| Use a relevant, single text link if it is necessary | Use the prominent button type ns-cta component (you should consider using a card instead for that purpose) |

Think about the information you are bringing to the user's attention. Is it relevant? Is it important? What do they need to know? Then summarise it in a concisely written format.
