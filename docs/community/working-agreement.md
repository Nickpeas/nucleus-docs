title: Working agreement
description: How we approach work between the Nucleus team and the community
---

> A set of working principles agreed between the teams using the deisng system and the core Nucleus team.



### We have a democratic process: by the people, for the people, upholding agreed standards.
We act as one design/UX community. We understand that processes and existing work is the outcome of another member of the community that was done with context and purpose.

### We prioritise in-person collaboration to build empathy, visibility and cross learning.
We recognise that working in person adds a layer of shared understanding, and brings down silos. This helps making we all work in similar ways with the same goal.

### We run an exchange programme to expose people to other teams
When possible, we integrate a member of the community into our team for a piece of work. We believe it's a grat way to discover, and master aspects of the deisgn system at speed. 

### We involve each other as early as possible
We recognise that by involving each other from the beginning on a piece of work prevents wasting time, and deliver value to our customers faster.

### We aim to always evolve, improve and add value
Everything we add to the system is has a proven added value, we want the system to always become better, with every single release.

### We measure and capture the impact of our work
We understand the impact of the changes we make, so we can repeat successes and avoid mistakes in the future.

### Everything we do is visible and accessible to all
We aim at making everything usable, understandable, and accessible by the community.

### Every component has a clear purpose
We design compoments for the purpose they fulfill not for how they look.

### We organise fun events regularly
When possible, we meet for fun events such as hackathons, meetups, conferences or just a night out to get to know wach other better.
