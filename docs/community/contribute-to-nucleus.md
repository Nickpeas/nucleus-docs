title: Contribute to Nucleus
description: Welcoming each and everyone to the Nucleus Design System.
---

> Our design system is a living organism, one that reflects and evolves with our collective learning.



## Contributing

The Nucleus team is looking after the system, making sure all of its parts work in a symbiotic way. Contributions can be made at every level, by anyone who has an idea on how to take it further. Whether it is a component, a pattern, a change to the documentation, the prototyping tool, every part of the system is open to contributions.

### What is a contribution?

- A contribution adds value to the system.
- A contribution can be something new or an improvement on an existing part of the system.
- A contribution is re-usable.
- A contribution is inclusive and accessible.
- A contribution is documented.

### Who can contribute?

Everyone.

Whether you are a designer, a software engineer, a tester, a solutions architect, a product owner, or a director: everyone is invited to advance Nucleus.


## What to expect?

Everyone plays a part in creating a coherent, consistent and engaging customer experience.
We worked with product teams to set up a contribution flow that makes sure a contribution ticks all the boxes to get added to the system.

Here is a visualisation of what to expect along the ride.

### Insights on existing Nucleus assets

For any feedback related to our Nucleus components and related documentation, we're using Github. This helps us provide a transparent track of all contributions and potential issues.

1. You can view our [requests status](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/projects/6).
2. You can create [bug reports](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Bug&template=a--bug-report.md&title=[bug]%20[ns-COMPONENT]), add a new [change request (RFC)](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RFC,+draft&template=b--request-a-change.md&title=[RFC]+Title+of+the+request), as well as react or comment on existing feedback.
3. We've prepared a template to structure incoming feedback, gather relevant insights, and help us respond accordingly.
4. If and once an issue is picked up, we'll ask to meet you to swap ideas and listen to your insights or make use of weekly design critique sessions.

### Suggestions for new Nucleus assets

We're working hard to grow Nucleus without sacrificing quality.

1. You can track and add suggestions for new assets in Github by checking our [requests status](https://github.com/ConnectedHomes/nucleus/projects/6).
2. Feel free to explore the styles and assets provided to suggest new components.
3. Please make sure to submit your experiments and learning. It helps us to track potential variations and roll out stable additions to all teams via Nucleus.

### Feedback on anything related to Nucleus

Reach us on Slack, via `#product-nucleus`. If there's anything on your mind.

### Events and updates

We know we don't have all the right answers, that's why we want to work with you in person, as well as connect you to other teams dealing with similar issues.

* We help to host and facilitate sessions and workshops focused on our current tasks as we go along. If you'd like us to help organise or be involved in something you're doing, do let us know.
* Just like other product teams, we're participating in weekly and monthly cross-team ceremonies.
